- **Cons:** No recurring revenue

### **Option 3: Revenue Share**

## 🚫 **What NOT to Waste Time On (Yet)**

Don't build these until you have paying clients:

- ❌ Perfect admin panel (build after first client signs)
- ❌ Multiple language support (unless client requests)
- ❌ Complex analytics (Google Analytics is enough)
- ❌ Blog/CMS system (not core to nightclub needs)
- ❌ Payment gateway integration (do after booking module is done)

**Rule:** Only build features that help you close the NEXT deal.
